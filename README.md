## Prerequisites

This is a pure Python application and requires a Python interpreter (Python 3.x recommended) installed on your system.

## How to Run

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the entire Python source code into a file named `calculator.py`.
2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved `calculator.py`.
3.  **Execute the Script:** Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    # or if you have multiple versions of python installed:
    python3 calculator.py
    ```

## Usage

When you run the script, the calculator will greet you and ask for your name. It will then present a menu of 15 different operations you can choose from by entering the corresponding number.

The program uses a loop so you can perform multiple calculations in one session by answering "Y" when prompted "Wanna use this program again? (Y/N)".
